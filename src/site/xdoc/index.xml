      <p>JmDNS is a Java implementation of multi-cast DNS and can be
        used for service registration and discovery in local area networks.
        JmDNS is fully compatible with
        <a href = "http://developer.apple.com/macosx/rendezvous/">Apple's Bonjour</a>.
      </p>
      <p>The
        <a href = "http://www.zeroconf.org/">Zeroconf</a>
        working group is working towards zero configuration IP networking.
        <a href = "http://www.multicastdns.org">Multi-cast DNS</a>
        and
        <a href = "http://www.dns-sd.org">DNS service discovery</a>
        provide a convient ways for devices and services to register themselves,
        and to discover other network-based services without relying on centrally administered services.</p>
      <p>
        Java as a language is not appropriate for low-level network configuration,
        but it is very useful for service registration and discovery. JmDNS provides
        easy-to-use pure-Java mDNS implementation that runs on most JDK1.6 compatible VMs.</p>
      <p>The code is released under the Apache 2.0 license so that it can be freely
        incorporated into other products and services.</p>

    <section name = "History">
      <p>The project was originally started in December 2002 by
        <a href = "mailto:javanator@users.sourceforge.net">Arthur van Hoff</a>
        at Stangeberry.
        In November 2003 the project was moved to SourceForge, and the name was changed from JRendezvous to JmDNS for legal reasons.</p>
